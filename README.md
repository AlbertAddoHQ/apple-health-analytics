## Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of my personal health data, focusing on key metrics such as **active energy burned**, **basal energy burned**, **distance walking & running**, **step count**, and **headphone audio exposure**. Using Python and popular data analysis libraries, I created visualizations and insights to better understand my activity and wellness trends.

## Data Source
The data was exported from **Apple Health**, which tracks various health metrics and activities on my iPhone.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning
- **matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **seaborn**: Statistical data visualization
- **WordCloud**: Generating word clouds for data exploration

## Key Features
- Analysis of **daily, weekly, and monthly trends** in active and basal energy expenditure.
- Visual correlation between **headphone audio exposure** and physical activity metrics.
- Detailed insights into **step count patterns** and **walking/running distances**.
- Identification of peak activity periods and energy expenditure distribution.
